# Terminal Bible

Are you a Linux Christian user? ~~I mean... probably very unlikely but perhaps~~
**OR**
Are you a christian who wants to read the bible on a terminal? ~~More likely I guess~~

Then THIS program is for you!

## The Serious Part

Ok I just wanted to make this for fun. That's all...
This bible uses bible-api.com to pull bible verses from the KJV translation, and I made this bible app for personal use.
Feel free to modify the code as you wish
