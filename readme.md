# Terminal Bible

Are you a Linux Christian user? ~~I mean... probably very unlikely but perhaps~~
**OR**
Are you a christian who wants to read the bible on a terminal? ~~More likely I guess~~

Then THIS program is for you!

## The Serious Part

### About
Ok I just wanted to make this for fun. That's all...
This bible requests from [bible-api by Tim Morgan](https://bible-api.com/) to pull bible verses from the KJV translation. I made this bible app for personal use, so feel free to modify the code as you wish. 
I will probably make updates to this as I add more features (and I do wish to convert this code to c++ too), but for now, this is what you get :)

### How to Use
You only need python to run this.

after you `git clone https://github.com/Henderythmix/Terminal-Bible.git`, make sure you can use the requests module with `pip install requests`, and then run the python script `python ./`
